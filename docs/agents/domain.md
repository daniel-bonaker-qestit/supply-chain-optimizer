# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout: single-context

This is a single-context repo. The skills should look for:

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the project glossary and shared vocabulary.
- **`docs/adr/`** — architectural decision records.

Neither file/dir exists yet. They are created lazily by `/grill-with-docs` once terms or decisions are actually resolved during a session — do not flag their absence preemptively.

## Before exploring, read these (when they exist)

- `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary.
- ADRs in `docs/adr/` that touch the area you're about to work in.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (X) — but worth reopening because…_
